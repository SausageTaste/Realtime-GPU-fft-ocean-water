# Realtime ocean water using GPU 

This project implements a method of using the GPU and FFT (fast fourier transform) in C++ to create a dynamic heightfield animation for moving ocean water waves. 
The code runs inVisual Studio 2019 for Windows 32bit, and includes necessary libraries to run it. The code was written was part of course DH2323 at KTH. 

It is based on the method the thesis work presented in "Realtime GPGPU FFT Ocean Water Simulation" by Fynn-Jorin Fl√ºgge. 

The resulting animation shows the heightfield of ocean waves as it changes through time, where white signifies higher elevation and black lower elevation.
